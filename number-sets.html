<h1>The Field Axioms of Arithmetic</h1>

<p>
<strong>Natural numbers</strong>                <br>
Are the counting numbers:                       <br>
\(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), \(\ldots\)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Integers</strong>                        <br>
Are the whole numbers,                           <br>
Positive, negative, and zero,                    <br>
With no fractional or decimal part:              <br>
\(0\), \(1\), \(-1\), \(2\), \(-2\), \(\ldots\)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Rational numbers</strong>     <br>
Are the numbers                       <br>
We can express as fractions           <br>
Of integers.                          <br>
Written with a fraction bar and       <br>
Integers on top and                   <br>
Integers on bottom,                   <br>
Reduced or unreduced.                 <br>
We may also find them hiding          <br>
In plain sight as                     <br>
Terminating or repeating decimals.    <br>
Natural numbers and integers          <br>
Are disguised within.                 <br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Real numbers</strong>                  <br>
Are the numbers                                <br>
We find on the number line.                    <br>
They are all the lengths and distances         <br>
In the world around us.                        <br>
The number line seems full                     <br>
With just the terminating decimals             <br>
And fuller still with the repeating decimals   <br>
But the rationals are as nothing               <br>
Compared to all the decimals that are.
</p>

<p>
Irrational as it may seem,                     <br>
The <strong>irrational numbers</strong>,       <br>
The numbers whose decimals                     <br>
Neither terminate nor repeat,                  <br>
Complement the rational numbers to             <br>
Complete the real numbers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Closure</strong>               <br>
A set of numbers                       <br>
With an operation \(*\)                <br>
Is <em><strong>closed</strong></em>    <br>
When applying the operation            <br>
To two of the numbers                  <br>
Results in the same type of number.
