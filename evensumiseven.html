<h1>The sum of two even integers is an even integer.</h1>

<p>
Let us prove that                                         <br>
The sum of any two even integers is also an even integer. <br>
</p>

<p>
We give the first even integer the name \(m\).   <br>
We give the second even integer the name \(n\).  <br>
Thus, the sum is expressed by the name \(m+n\).  <br>
First, we must prove that \(m+n\) is an integer. <br>
Second, we must prove that \(m+n\) is even.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the integers are closed under addition. <br>
Since \(m\) and \(n\) are integers,                 <br>
It then follows from this closure property          <br>
That \(m+n\) is an integer.                         <br>
Thus we have shown the first of the two things that we were to prove.
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(n\) is even. <br>
By the definition of even, <br>
There is an integer \(k\)  <br>
Such that \(n=2k\).
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(m\) is even. <br>
By the definition of even, <br>
There is an integer \(l\)  <br>
Such that \(m=2l\).
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(m+n\) is the sum.    <br>
We may substitute \(2k\) for \(n\) <br>
And \(2l\) for \(m\).              <br>
Thus, \(m+n=2k+2l\).
</p>

<p>
Recall the distributive property of multiplication over addition. <br>
It says that for any real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\),        <br>
We may conclude that \(x\cdot(y+z)=x\cdot y+x\cdot z\).           <br>
Using \(2\) for \(x\), \(k\) for \(y\) and \(l\) for \(z\),       <br>
It follows that \(2(k+l)=2k+2l\).
</p>

<p>
Recall the symmetric property of equality.  <br>
It says that \(y=x\) when \(x=y\).          <br>
From \(2(k+l)=2k+2k\), it follows           <br>
That \(2k+2l=2(k+l)\).
</p>

<p>
Now we know two things:                           <br>
That \(m+n=2k+2l\)                                <br>
And that \(2k+2l=2(k+l)\).                        <br>
We also know the transitive property of equality, <br>
Which says that \(x=z\) when \(x=y\) and \(y=z\). <br>
It follows that \(m+n=2(k+l)\).
</p>

<p>
The end is near  <br>
Now that we know <br>
\(m+n=2(k+l)\).
</p>

<p>
Since the integers are closed under addition, <br>
And since \(k\) and \(l\) are integers,       <br>
We may conclude that \(k+l\) is an integer.   <br>
Let us say that \(p\) is this integer \(k+l\).
</p>

<p>
Now that we know that \(k+l\) is the integer \(p\),                    <br>
And notice that \(m+n\) can be expressed as                            <br>
Two times the integer \(p\).                                           <br>
We may apply the definition of even                                    <br>
To say and to know that \(m+n\) is even.                               <br>
Thus we have shown the second of the two things that we were to prove.
</p>

<p>
Thus we have shown both of the two things that we were to prove.         <br>
We have shown that when we start with two even integers \(m\) and \(n\), <br>
Their sum, \(m+n\), is an even integer,                                  <br>
Quod erat demonstrandum.
