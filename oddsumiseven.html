<h1>The sum of two odd integers is an even integer.</h1>

<p>
Let us prove that                                   <br>
The sum of any two odd integers is an even integer. <br>
</p>

<p>
We give the first even integer the name \(m\).   <br>
We give the second even integer the name \(n\).  <br>
Thus, the sum is expressed by the name \(m+n\).  <br>
First, we must prove that \(m+n\) is an integer. <br>
Second, we must prove that \(m+n\) is even.
</p>

<p>
Recall that the integers are closed under addition. <br>
Since \(m\) and \(n\) are integers,                 <br>
It then follows from this closure property          <br>
That \(m+n\) is an integer.                         <br>
Thus we have shown the first of the two things that we were to prove.
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(n\) is odd.  <br>
By the definition of odd,  <br>
There is an integer \(k\)  <br>
Such that \(n=2k+1\).
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(m\) is odd.  <br>
By the definition of odd,  <br>
There is an integer \(l\)  <br>
Such that \(m=2l+1\).
</p>

<p>
Recall that \(m+n\) is the sum.      <br>
We may substitute \(2k+1\) for \(n\) <br>
And \(2l+1\) for \(m\).              <br>
Thus, \(m+n=(2k+1)+(2l+1)\).
</p>

<p>
Recall the associative property of addition.                      <br>
It says that for any real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\),        <br>
We may conclude that \((x+y)+z=x+(y+z)\).                         <br>
Using \(2k\) for \(x\), \(1\) for \(y\) and \((2l+1)\) for \(z\), <br>
It follows that \((2k+1)+(2l+1)=2k+(1+(2l+1))\).                  <br>
</p>

<p>
Recall the commutative property of addition.        <br>
It says that for any real numbers \(x\) and \(y\),  <br>
We may conclude that \(x+y=y+x\).                   <br>
It follows that \(2k+(1+(2l+1))=2k+((2l+1)+1)\).      
</p>

<p>
We may use the associative property of addition again:  <br>
\(2k+((2l+1)+1)=2k+(2l+(1+1))\).                        <br>
We note that \(1+1=2\):                                 <br>
\(2k+(2l+(1+1))=2k+(2l+2)\).                            <br>
We may use the associative property of addition again:  <br>
\(2k+(2l+2)=(2k+2l)+2\).                               <br>
We may use the distributive property of multiplication over addition <br>
For the first time in this proof:                       <br>
\((2k+2l)+2=2(k+l)+2\).                                 <br>
And we may use the distributive property of multiplication over addition once more: <br>
\(2(k+l)+2=2((k+l)+1)\).
</p>

<p>
Now we know several things:                <br>
That \(m+n=(2k+1)+(2l+1)\)                 <br>
And that \((2k+1)+(2l+1)=2k+(1+(2l+1))\)   <br>
And that \(2k+(1+(2l+1))=2k+((2l+1)+1)\)   <br>
And that \(2k+((2l+1)+1)=2k+(2l+(1+1))\)   <br>
And that \(2k+(2l+(1+1))=2k+(2l+2)\)       <br>
And that \(2k+(2l+2)=(2k+2l)+2\)           <br>
And that \((2k+2l)+2=2(k+l)+2\)            <br>
And that \(2(k+l)+2=2((k+l)+1)\)           <br>
</p>

<p>
We also know the transitive property of equality, <br>
Which says that \(x=z\) when \(x=y\) and \(y=z\). <br>
It follows that \(m+n=2((k+l)+1)\).
</p>

<p>
The end is near  <br>
Now that we know <br>
\(m+n=2((k+l)+1)\).
</p>

<p>
Since the integers are closed under addition, <br>
And since \(k\) and \(l\) are integers,       <br>
We may conclude that \(k+l\) is an integer.
</p>

<p>
Since the integers are closed under addition, <br>
And since \(k+l\) and \(1\) are integers,       <br>
We may conclude that \((k+l)+1\) is an integer.   <br>
Let us say that \(p\) is this integer \((k+l)+1\).
  </p>

<p>
Now that we know that \((k+l)+1\) is the integer \(p\),                    <br>
And notice that \(m+n\) can be expressed as                            <br>
Two times the integer \(p\).                                           <br>
We may apply the definition of even                                    <br>
To say and to know that \(m+n\) is even.                               <br>
Thus we have shown the second of the two things that we were to prove.
</p>

<p>
Thus we have shown both of the two things that we were to prove.         <br>
We have shown that when we start with two odd integers \(m\) and \(n\), <br>
Their sum, \(m+n\), is an even integer,                                  <br>
Quod erat demonstrandum.
